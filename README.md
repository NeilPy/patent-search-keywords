# patent-search-keywords
Very basic level python code for finding out key phrases and words in a patent abstract

Some functions and snippets for the code have been picked up from antiboredom/patent-generator (https://github.com/antiboredom/patent-generator)

# How to make it work for you?

Change URLs in URL_set list to make it work for any Google patent URL.

Change search patterns in search_patterns2 to customise for your requirement.

# This code will undergo further specific edits as I build better search patterns

I will be updating the progress on <a href ="http://www.thinkpatcri.com/"> my patent blog www.thinkpatcri.com </a> as well as sharing these updates on my <a href ="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nileshsakpal/"> LinkedIn profile - Nilesh Sakpal </a>
