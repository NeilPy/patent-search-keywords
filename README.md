# patent-search-keywords
Very basic level python code for finding out key phrases and words in a patent abstract


Some functions and snippets for the code have been picked up from antiboredom/patent-generator (https://github.com/antiboredom/patent-generator)

Change URLs in URL_set list to make it work for any Google patent URL.
Change search patterns in search_patterns2 to customise for your requirement.

This code will undergo further specific edits as I build better search patterns.
